# Code of Conduct
### Slack Code of Conduct


The Cuvva Community Slack is a place where Cuvva users should feel welcome and included to share their opinions. And while it should be used for differing opinions, we also want to ensure people always feel safe üëç

The purpose of this document is to outline the community values - what we do, and don‚Äôt, stand for - and the measures we take to protect them.

The use of the Cuvva logo as a status is only to be used by Cuvva staff (should they choose to be part of the community) and is not to be used to mislead other members of the community in any way.


# Inclusivity üôå
We want everyone to feel included in our community. In particular, nobody should ever feel excluded on the basis of their:

* Gender, gender identity, or gender expression
* Sexual orientation
* Disability or medical condition
* Physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
* Race
* Age
* Religion

A note on politics: Political discussions are not banned, but we don't tolerate using slack as a personal soapbox to air political opinions. As always, our moderators have the final say on this.

# Our Shared Values ‚òÄÔ∏è

#### You agree that:

  * We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
  * We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
  * We respect people‚Äôs boundaries and identities.
  * We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
  * We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.
  * We do not suggest or speculate on ways of breaking the law. We encourage the practice of [responsibly disclosing](https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/) security vulnerabilities.

#### We actively work towards:

  * Being a safe community.
  * Cultivating a network of support and encouragement for each other.
  * Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

#### We condemn:

  * Stalking or publishing private information (‚Äòdoxxing)
  * Threats of harm or harassment.
  * Anything that compromises people‚Äôs safety.


# Consequences for breaking the rules üö®

We take a strong stance on enforcing our community guidelines. In severe cases, such as posting content that we have zero tolerance on, we will immediately ban and remove the user from Slack.

For other violations, we‚Äôll follow these steps -

First offence: we‚Äôll issue a formal warning, through the community or a Slack Direct Message. Whenever a warning is issued, we will refer back to this document and indicate the part of the Code of Conduct we feel has been breached.

Second offence: a further warning will be issued, in stronger terms. Offenders will be reminded of the consequences of continuing to break the Code of Conduct - which can include suspension or removal from Slack.

Third offence: we will take action. This can be a short-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour), a long-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour on a large scale, or a significant incident), or outright removal from Slack (for extremely serious situations).

For future offences, if - following a suspension - the user returns and continues to be disruptive and act contrary to the above agreements, a full removal will be implemented without warning.

tldr; users receive two warnings (the second stronger), then an appropriate action, and following offences will result in removal.
